1-) Virtual dispatch is mechanism which occurs when programmer uses virtual functions.
This mechanism allows programmer to use runtime polymorphism. That means user is 
using overriding to occur virtual dispatch.

2-) If the there are 2 classes called B and C which are inherited from a class called A. 
At the same time there is a D class which is also inherited from not only from B but also from
C class. In this kinda situation class D includes 2 A classes which is not good for the program. 
To fix the diamond from users needs to virtual inheritance.

3-) auto and decltype keywords both used for type deductions but there is an important difference
between them. decltype always gets exactlty the same type as the variable type but while using 
the auto type deduction the type deduction could be different. For example const will be gone 
while using auto. Here is an example about it.
