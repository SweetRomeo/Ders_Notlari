1-) What is virtual dispatch?
2-) What is the diamond problem? How to solve it?
3-) Diamond problem occurs when there are 2 multi level inheritance and the first
parent class are the same but also the last derived class are the same. For this we have two times of the first parent class in the last derived class.
User can solve the diamond problem by using virtual inheritance. The two child classes which inherited from the parent class needs to be done by using the virtual keyword.
